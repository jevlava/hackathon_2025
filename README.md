## 🌊 FES: Flood Event Simulacrum  
### Team Name: **JSJ 🐱🐱💻**

## 🚨 The Problem Solved
Flooding poses a major risk to the **Corpus Christi area**, often leaving residents and emergency services without reliable information on safe travel routes. Traditional navigation systems fail to account for real-time or predicted flood conditions, putting lives and property at risk.

## 💡 The Solution Built
**FES (Flood Event Simulacrum)** is an intelligent route-planning system powered by machine learning.  
 
Our system:  
- Predicts potential **future flood events** in the Corpus Christi area.  
- Uses those predictions to **map out the safest and fastest travel routes**.  
- Alerts users when a **destination is not viable** due to high flood probability.  
 
This project bridges predictive modeling and real-world navigation, enabling safer and more informed travel decisions during flood events.

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- **Languages & Frameworks:** Python, Go, React  
- **Mapping & Visualization:** Maptiler, MapLibre  
- **Routing API:** OpenRouteService    
- **Language Uses:** Go was used to handle API requests and route computation between the ML model and the React frontend, ensuring efficient data flow and scalability, and Python was used to create the actual ML model to predict the flood events.

## ⚙️ Challenges Faced
- Defining a **clear project goal** under time pressure  
- Obtaining and processing **reliable flood event datasets** for ML training  
- Handling **large file uploads** and GitHub repository limits  
- Completing the system within a **36-hour hackathon timeframe**

## 🚀 Future Plans
- Develop a **more accurate and defensible ML model**  
- Enhance the **frontend website** for better user interaction and visualization  
- Incorporate **additional environmental and real-time data sources** for improved flood prediction  
- Explore deployment as a **mobile or emergency-response tool** for local use
